    <h1>Captain Drone Killer</h1>

    <pre>  
I'm making a new product from Drudget called "Captain Drone Killer".
      
Its purpose is to detect and bring down drones, using a variety of methods.

They include:    
  - spread spectrum signal jamming (using SDR)
  - detection and locating drones using trilateration and triangulation from radio and audio sensors
  - anti-AI based drones, utilising backdoors or kill switches in their products, or exploiting security flaws in their code (e.g. buffer overflows).

It will be open source.
